    <h3>To me, great design is the perfect marriage of aesthetics and functionality. The ultimate challenge, and what I enjoy most, is to find a solution which enhances the purpose of the product through visual design.

    When I am not designing, I enjoy reading, painting, <a href="http://medium.com/@RaelinaMarie">writing,</a> riding my bike, discovering new cuisine, traveling and doing things in nature.</h3>
