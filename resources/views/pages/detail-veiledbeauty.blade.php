    <!--Description-->
    <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12 flex-center">
        <p>One of my first professional projects was to create a logo for a new company called Veiled Beauty.
            <br><br>
            Veiled Beauty is a fashion hijab company. The client wanted a symbol that could be used as an
            emblem for their brand as well as the logo for their company. The client was inspired by the Art Nouveau
            movement and wanted these design elements to be incorporated into the logo.
